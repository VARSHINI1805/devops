# 🐳 DevOps Day 2 – Docker

This repository branch contains Day-2 focused on Docker installation, configuration, and container management.

---

## 📌 OBJECTIVE

The objective of Day-2 is to understand Docker fundamentals including:

- Installing Docker on Ubuntu
- Running containers
- Managing images
- Port mapping
- Container lifecycle management

---

## 🛠 STEP 1 – Install Docker

### Update system:
```bash
sudo apt update
```

### Install Docker:
```bash
sudo apt install docker.io -y
```

### Start Docker service:
```bash
sudo systemctl start docker
```

### Enable Docker at boot:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

### Verify Docker:
```bash
docker --version
docker info
```

---

## 📦 STEP 2 – Basic Docker Commands

- `docker images` → Shows downloaded Docker images  
- `docker pull nginx` → Download nginx image from Docker Hub  
- `docker run nginx` → Run container from image  
- `docker run -d nginx` → Run container in background mode  
- `docker ps` → Show running containers  
- `docker ps -a` → Show all containers (including stopped)  
- `docker stop <container_id>` → Stop running container  
- `docker rm <container_id>` → Remove container  
- `docker rmi <image_name>` → Remove image  

---

## 🌐 STEP 3 – Run Nginx Container

### Run Nginx with port mapping:
```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx
```

### Open browser:
```
http://<server-ip>:8080
```

Example:
```
http://192.168.117.128:8080
```

---

## 📂 STEP 4 – Docker File Structure Understanding

Image → Blueprint  
Container → Running instance of image  
Docker Hub → Online image repository  
Port Mapping → Connect container port to host port  

Example:
```
-p 8080:80
```

Host Port → 8080  
Container Port → 80  

---

## 🎯 LEARNING OUTCOME

✔ Installed Docker successfully  
✔ Understood Docker architecture  
✔ Pulled images from Docker Hub  
✔ Ran containers  
✔ Used port mapping  
✔ Managed container lifecycle  
✔ Practiced basic Docker commands

# DEVOPS DAY 3  
## GIT SSH CONFIGURATION AND BRANCH WORKFLOW

Repository: `devops`

---

## Objective

To configure Git with SSH authentication and create a new branch for development work.

---

## Step 1: Git Configuration

```bash
git config --global user.name "VARSHINI1805"
git config --global user.email "varshinisureshkumar224@gmail.com"
git config --list
```

Purpose:  
This ensures that all commits are recorded with correct author details.

---

## Step 2: SSH Key Generation

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "varshinisureshkumar224@gmail.com"
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
ssh -T git@github.com
```

Added the SSH public key to GitHub under:  
Settings → SSH and GPG Keys  

Authentication was successful.

Purpose:  
SSH allows secure communication between local Ubuntu system and GitHub without using a password each time.
